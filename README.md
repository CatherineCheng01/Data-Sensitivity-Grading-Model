# Data-Sensitivity-Grading-Model

Here we provide a statistical analysis result, two data sets and a model code.

"Code" is a code implementation example and description of the application of the data  sensitivity grading model GDSG. The grading process and the parameters selecting are set according to the case study section in this paper. This codebase is implemented using the Python 3 programming language, predominantly leveraging the scientific data analysis libraries pandas and numpy. The format of the code is compatible with Jupyter Notebooks.

For utilization, users are advised to structure their data in alignment with the provided example datasets, ensuring the inclusion of requisite fields. While the sample data are not stored in a database format, the organization of data and the logic of the code implementation are not in conflict with the structure of large-scale databases. Modification of data input parameters would suffice to accommodate different data sources. "Dataset in case study" shows the data and dataset construction examples in case study. "Dataset of personal data" covers the data in the section 'application of personal data grading'. "Statistical analysis of data synthesis" is the content of standardization and statistical analysis of 13 kinds of personal data and industry data with industry commonalities and characteristics selected from three universities and seven data types covered by research and standards, so as to achieve the goal of standardized comparison of data sensitivity in different industries
